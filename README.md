# ChromaticScaleSNN
Convolution Neural Network with SNN Toolbox integration for Neuromorphic Computing 

## Idea
### Top Down approach
Convert a working Convolutional Neural Network into a Spiking Neural Network.  
Build a Convolutional Neural Network to classify spectrogram images.  
Build spectrogram images from audio files of the instruments.  
Separate necessary audio from instruments by the Chromatic Scale.
